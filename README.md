Then you need to enter the name of the city for which you are looking for a weather forecast.
To make it more precise put the _city's name, comma, 2-letter country code (ISO3166)_. You will get all proper cities in chosen country.
The order is important - the first is city name then comma then country. Example - _London, GB_ or _New York, US_.
